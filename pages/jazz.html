          Rudy Gobert left out of this years all-star game, after being
          ranked by ESPN as the 12th best player in the NBA. Ricky Rubio
          asks if it defense, or winning that wasn't taken into account.
        </p>
        <p class="news">
          It comes out that the Jazz and the Grizzlys almost had a deal
          which would have been headlined by the swap of Ricky Rubio and
          Mike Conley. Although the deal is no longer on the Table, Jazz
          Fans have had mixed reactions to the reported talks.

          After starting his sophomore season in a slump, Donovan Mitcell
          apears to have snapped out of it. While his efforts to come back
          against the Trail Blazers may have been to little too late, it was
          refreshing to see him as a carrying force for the team.
        </p>
        <p class="news">
          Analysts and fans alike agree that the only thing holding the Jazz
          back from being serious title contenders is a lack of scoring ability.
          Outside of Mitchell the Jazz lack a consistent scoring threat. Adding
          a small forward who poses a significant scoring threat would entierly
          change the look of this team.
