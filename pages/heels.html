          UNC has been a mystery this year. Big wins against teams like Gonzaga
          and Virginia Tech make them look like a force to be reckoned with come
          march, while struggles against Michigan on the raod, and even worse, Louisvile
          at home, leave college basketball fans wondering if they can make it past the
          first round.

          Projected lottery pick, Freshman Nassir Little's play has been anything but
          consistent. While many accuse Roy Williams of limiting his playing time in
          order to prevent a one and done, his inconsitency and sloppieness make it hard
          to justify giving him a regular starting role.
        </p>
        <p class="news">
          Luke Maye remains the face of the team, as he should. In his senior year he
          continues to impress, not just with his skill as a basketball player, but in
          his ability to lead and inspire others. Whether or not he'll be a presence in
          the NBA remains to be seen, but he will go down as a UNC great without a doubt.
